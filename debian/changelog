ros-indigo-robot-self-filter (0.1.29-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * pr2_navigation_self_filter -> robot_self_filter
  * Add robot_self_filter namespace before bodies and shapes namespace.
    geometric_shapes package also provides bodies and shapes namespace
    and same classes and functions. If a program is linked with
    geometric_shapes and robot_self_filter, it may cause strange behavior
    because of symbol confliction.

    This is needed because pcl drops some value of timestamp.
    So pcl::fromROSMsg and pcl::toROSMsg does not work to get correct timestamp.
    Protected member variables in SelfMask for subclass of SelfMask
